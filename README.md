## Required Tech:
1. Python 3.7 or higher with libraries :
             
             i)   Pandas
             ii)  Numpy
             iii)  Pickle
             iv)   Streamlit
   or you can simply write a code in CLI
   
               $ pip install requirements.txt
             
 2. Any Python IDE :   I've used Spyder 4.1.0
 3. Python Prompt : to run the webapp locally
 
 
 
 
 ## Procedure :
 
 1. Create a new environment in python prompt  : Use this procedure :  https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
 2. Then create a folder and add all the files in it. (example : heart_disease)
 3. Open Python prompt and go the that particular folder  : write command
                              
                              $ cd /d your_drive_name\created_folder
                              e.g.           $ cd /d C:\heart_disease
 4. Type one more command to start the webapp on your web browser locally:
                             
                             $ streamlit run heart_disease_app.py
                             
 5. If the environment doesen't loads automatically , put the page URL into your suitable browser and then it will start.
